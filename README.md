# DahliaApp
A showcase of the application I created with Dahlia Lights. 

The application used computer vision to adjust lighting in the home. 

Users with Phillips Hue smart lights would calibrate by pointing their phone at furniture and objects around the room, while the lights flashed on and off. 

Then, various lighting 'scenes' would be constructed corresponding to different activities that the user might be doing. For example, a 'TV' scene might lower the lights the calibration found to impact the TV. 

During regular use a user could select between various scenes, as well as toggle settings such as brightness and color temperature manually.

If a user had multiple rooms with smart lights, each room could be defined, calibrated, and then controlled separately within the app.  

Custom scenes could also be created based around the results of the calibration. For example, a user could set their preference for their reading chair to be illuminated as much as possible, while having their couch only have a moderate amount of light.

# App Store Description

Dahlia is a personal lighting designer for your smart lights. Using computer vision, Dahlia measures how your lighting interacts with your furniture to create personalized lighting scenes for your home. 

*Dahlia currently works with Philips Hue smart lights*

INTELLIGENT LIGHTING DESIGN
Dahlia designs lighting to complement your activities, not distract from them. Whether it's a focusing light on your reading chair or removing distracting glare from your TV, Dahlia understands your room layout to create custom scenes.

SIMPLE CONTROL
We've removed the clutter that makes smart light apps too complex. What remains is an intuitive interface designed for quick interactions so you can get back to your life. 

HOW IT WORKS
- Pair the Dahlia App with your Philips Hue Bridge
- Select the room(s) you want to get custom lighting designs for
- Make sure the room is DARK with your Hue lights as the only source of light
- Identify the pieces of furniture you use in the room 
- Point the camera at each piece of furniture and the lights will cycle on and off
- Once you're done with all the furniture in that room, let us know what types of activities you enjoy there
- Then your custom lighting scenes will be generated for you to view and tweak to perfection!

*WARNING: during Scene Design your lights will flash quickly. Avoid using the app if you have a problem with flashing lights*
